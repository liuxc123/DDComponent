        TitleModel(title: "Macrotarsomys petteri, Petter's big-footed mouse, is a Malagasy rodent. It is the largest in its genus, with a head and body length of 150 mm (5.9 in) and body mass of 105 g (3.7 oz). The upperparts are brown, darkest in the middle of the back, and the underparts are white to yellowish. The animal has long whiskers, short forelimbs, and long hindfeet. The tail ends in a prominent tuft of long, light hairs. The skull is robust and the molars are low-crowned and cuspidate. The species most resembles, and may be most closely related to, the greater big-footed mouse. The specific name, petteri, honors French zoologist François Petter for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. M. petteri is now found only in southwestern Madagascar's Mikea Forest, which is threatened by human development. Subfossil records indicate that it used to be more widely distributed in southern Madagascar; climatic changes and competition with introduced species may have led to the shift in its distribution.

        TitleModel(title: "On 8 June 2017, the United Kingdom general election of 2017 took place, which resulted in the Conservative Party losing its parliamentary majority. The 650 parliamentary constituencies each elected one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons, otherwise known as the lower house of Parliament. Under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, an election had not been due until 7 May 2020. However, on 19 April 2017 a snap election, called by Prime Minister Theresa May, was passed by a 522-to-13 vote in the House of Commons.", controllerClass: nil),
        TitleModel(title: "The Conservative Party, (governing since 2010 as a senior coalition partner prior to 2015 and as a majority government thereafter) was defending a majority of 12, against the Labour Party. The official opposition is led by Jeremy Corbyn. In order to \"strengthen [her] hand in forthcoming Brexit negotiations,\"[1] May hoped to secure a larger Parliamentary majority for the Conservative Party.", controllerClass: nil),
        TitleModel(title: "Since the previous general election, opinion polls had shown public opinion consistently increase for the Conservatives over Labour. At the beginning of the campaign, the Conservative Party had a 20-point lead, and peaked by 25 points in the early weeks of canvassing. This triggered widespread expectations of a landslide victory, similar to that of 1983 United Kingdom general election. However, in the latter stages of the campaign, their lead began to diminish as Labour Party support surged in the final weeks. Despite the narrowing opinion polls, the election results still came as a surprise for major political commentators.", controllerClass: nil),
        TitleModel(title: "Following the election results, the Conservatives spoke with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland, whose 10 seats could allow for the formation of a minority Conservative government.[2]", controllerClass: nil),
        TitleModel(title: "Although the Labour Party only secured second place, Labour won its greatest share of the popular vote since 2001, and for the first time since 1997, gained more seats than it lost. Additionally the party secured a positive swing of 9.6%, the largest swing for an opposition party since Clement Attlee led Labour to win a large majority in 1945. However, the Conservative Party also gained an unusually high share of public support, winning its highest vote share since 1983 and obtaining a higher number of individual votes than any party since 1992. The result may represent a shift back towards two-party politics in the country, ending a prolonged gradual trend in the opposite direction.", controllerClass: nil),
        TitleModel(title: "The third-largest party, the Scottish National Party (SNP), had won 56 of the 59 Scottish constituencies in 2015, but returned with 21 fewer seats. Twelve of these seats went to the Conservatives, in a reversal of a general trend in other parts of the UK. It was suggested part of the reason was a backlash against the SNP's calls for Scottish independence and tactical voting for the unionist parties.[3][4] The Liberal Democrats won several seats from the Conservatives and Scottish National Party, but also lost seats, with an overall increase of three. In Northern Ireland, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin both gained additional seats, capturing all the seats won at the last election by the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). Support for the UK Independence Party, which enjoyed a significant portion of the popular vote in 2015, was largely wiped out.[5] The Green Party maintained its single seat, and there was one independent MP elected (for the Northern Ireland constituency of North Down).", controllerClass: nil),

Negotiation positions following the UK's invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union in March 2017 to leave the EU also featured significantly in the campaign, as did the regular major issues of the economy, education, jobs and the National Health Service.", controllerClass: nil),
